> Introduction (67 words)  

The Olympic games and in particular the footbal world cup are reducing the level of worldwide tension and provide safe way to release emotions. I somewhat agree with this opinion because the international sport events helps uniting people and allows to cheer loudly for your nation; however, due to the competitions such that evoke unfriendly emotions in the loser side, it often ends up badly for people.

The main reason why I believe popular events helps to decrees the international tensions is because people from another nations may communicate with each other for common topics that uniting them and behaviour for other nation becoming more friendly. To illustrate, once I visited the “Iron Man” competition. I was there to support my lovely sportsman. Surprisely, I met a man who arrived to support the same sportsman as me, despite that fact that we are of different nations. After that, I started to understand his more.

In addition, the patriotic emotional stress are accumulating by many reasons. It may affect on the life of people themselves. To negate this negative effect people may cheers loudly for their lovely commands or sportsman, thereby throw out their collected emotions.
 
However, where is the winner there always is a loser. Often the defeated side behaves itself unfriendly. This is because some people can’t admit defeat and start hating everyone around them. For instance, after a football
games one crowd of fans fights with another one,  its looks horrible.

> Conclusion (60 words)  
In conclusion, I somewhat believe that the international sporting occasions may be one of the acceptable ways to reduce tensions or to free patriotic emotions safely. However, I admit that sometimes patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. Given this situation, it seems that government  needs to pay a lot of attentions to all go well for events like that.
